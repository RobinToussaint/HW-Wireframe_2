          <p>Hiya, I am Robin Toussaint but my friends call me Rob so you can call me Robin, just kidding. 
            I’m a Jersey native who moved to New York in 2010 with hopes of becoming a journalist. 
            That plan was later put to rest and I fell in love with digital. I like long walks to the bank
            and red wine. I have a large family and many of them live in New Jersey. I am extremely happy 
            about taking this class and I hope this homework assigment turns as well.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Hi, my name is Robin and I work in a button factory. I have a husband a dog and a family. One day my boss came up to me and say, “Hey Robin, are you busy?” I said “no”. He said push this button on your right hand. *Pushing button with right hand*
